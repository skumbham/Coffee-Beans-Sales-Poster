## Project Overview

The Coffee & Beans Sales Analysis project aims to provide deep insights into the sales trends and performance of Beans N Leaves products across the United States. Utilizing comprehensive sales data, we have developed a series of visualizations to uncover patterns in sales distribution by state, performance of sales representatives, monthly sales trends, and product-driven profitability.

## Repository Contents

- **Coffee & Beans Sales Poster.ai**: Adobe Illustrator file containing the final sales poster design.
- **Coffee & Beans Sales Poster.pdf**: PDF version of the sales poster for easy viewing and distribution.
- **Beans-N-Leaves-2019-2021 Sales Dataset.csv**: The raw dataset used for the analysis, covering sales data from 2019 to 2021.
- **R Script for Visualizations.R**: The R script file containing all the code used to generate the data visualizations included in the poster.

## Tools Used

- **R**: Used for data manipulation, calculation, and visualization. The script demonstrates proficient use of libraries such as `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `usmap`, `lubridate`, and `scales`.
- **Adobe Illustrator**: Used for the final design and layout of the sales poster, showcasing advanced graphic design skills and the ability to translate analytical data into professional visual content.

## Visualizations

The visualizations created for this project include:
1. **Sales Distribution by State**: A colored map categorizing states based on their sales volume.
2. **Top 10 Representatives**: A bar chart highlighting the sales and profit figures for the top performers.
3. **Monthly Sales vs. Profit Trends**: A combined bar and line graph showing trends over time.
4. **Product Driven Profitability**: Pie and bar charts that detail revenue and profit breakdowns by product type.

These visualizations provide stakeholders with clear, actionable insights into market dynamics and sales performance.

## How to Use

To replicate the analysis and visualizations:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R script in an R environment (such as RStudio).
3. Run the script to generate the visualizations. Ensure you have the necessary packages installed.
4. Open the `.ai` file in Adobe Illustrator to view or modify the sales poster design.
